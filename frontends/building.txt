1. Make sure you have the required dependencies, see 
   frontends/dependencies/README.txt

2. Generate build files
    We use cmake to setup building. Set flags for the frontends you wish to
    build. The standalone pattern editor will always be built.

    E.g. for 3dsMax:
        mkdir _build
        cd _build
        cmake -DBUILD_3DSMAX=true -D3DSMAX_VERSIONS="2019;2021" ..

    Possible options are:
        BUILD_3DSMAX (bool)
        BUILD_MAYA (bool)
        BUILD_VRAYSTANDALONE (bool)
    
    Ther are also settings for where to look for SDK paths. Consult the
    CMakeLists.txt files.

3. Compile projects

    cmake --build . --target install --config relwithdebinfo

    Output will be in a newly created frontends/release folder.
